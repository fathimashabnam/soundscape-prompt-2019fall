Changes in Clips for Final --
This shows my extension of the ending background noise (to make the end less abrupt) and the insertion of the mystery sound

Changes in Clips for Final --
Here, I changed the background store music to drag through after the door shut (fade out effect was done with the envelope tool)

Screenshot of the Recordings file --
This is where I kept all the sound files I recorded (dialogue, footsteps, background chatter) plus the downloaded background music. This allowed me to copy/paste it into the actual Audacity file, and edit clips with a backup in this file.
