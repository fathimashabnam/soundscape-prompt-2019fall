17/09/2019 - Soundscape Narrative Progress 

For this soundscape project, I challenged myself by weaving together a story in a new platform (Audacity). I recorded diaogue and other sounds, such as footsteps, and downloaded soundclips with appropriate permissions. I then used new tools, such as the envelope tool and pitch changes to edit, magnify or fade the sounds together. 

In this draft, I have all the intended clips and the progression plan of my story is laid out. After spending time working on each of the individual parts, I have a few areas I would like to improve on. One major challenge of mine was recording speech. I planned to voice four characters, and I knew it wouldn't be easy, since I was never skilled at accents. For this, I watched several videos on voice acting, and how to impersonate Disney characters (they have a distinct tone and speech). Despite my efforts, I worry that the sounds of the mothers character and Dania sound too similar to a 3rd party. I have current plans to ask my friend to voice the mother's character, but I will decide on this after my classmates' feedback.  

Another change I want to make is to the script itself. I realized after recording, when I was piecing it all together, that I needed to record more responses from the mother to connect the story more naturally. Furthermore, I think the beginning clip is a little too quiet. I may add more background sounds to the store scene, but for this too, I will see what feedback my peers give. 

I think my biggest concern remains if listeners will understand what is happening and will pay attention to the sounds I want them to...
