12/09/2019 - Soundscape Narrative Progress 

So far, I have arranged the audio clips for the beginning scene at the Disney store, where Dania gets her doll. I was able to find satisfactory audio clips of
Disney themed background music (proved to be harder than I presumed- thanks Disney Legal Department), door-related sounds, and the cashier. I have 
temporarily recorded dialogue, split them into three separate conversations, and used them as placeholder clips to ease layering of other clips. With this placeholder recorded dialogue, I played around 
with fading effects, and how I wanted to position the listener (is the doll close to the enterance, or further away? Should Dania wonder around a bit before picking 
up Ariel or should she come in knowing what she wants? How loud must the volume of the employee's French greeting be (again, closeness to the doll)? Should there be fading effects 
here too?). In the screenshot, some of the fading effects can be seen (most prominent and permenant one is the quick fading out effect of the Disney instrumental store music after the door chime 
our main characters leave the store). For this scene, the changes I want to make (in addition to re-recording the dialogue) is add footsteps to 
cement the idea of distance, and add a little background chatter. I don't want to distract the listener from the background music here (I am hoping the class Disney music
will aid in the listener's understanding of what's happening), but I think a little background chatter would be helpful in painting a realistic picture. 

The last clip seems to be the busiest (and there is more to the right that you can't see in this screenshot). This is the background sound 
for outdoor Disneyland. I got this by carefully (and rather painfully) cutting parts of a Disney vlog I found with a CC-Attrubutions license. However, 
after I chopped it, I listened to it, and it feels too fast paced. After taking out all the dialogue, there are just too many cuts for it to be a good transitioning 
background sound. I realize I am going to part with most of it (sad), but I also realized that I can chop away sound to change scenery within the park (yay). 
To show that Dania is walking around and time is passing (without dragging the clip to be 15 mins long), I can change the background sound to be a little 
choppy. I found other clips that have more background sound, and I plan to use a combination of the different clips for outdoor background sound.
