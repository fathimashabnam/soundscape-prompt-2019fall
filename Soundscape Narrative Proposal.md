<h1> Soundscape Narrative Proposal </h1>

**Title:** Part of Her World 

**Main concept:**

The audio will follow Dania, a fun-loving 6-year old as she experiences Disneyland Paris, through the eyes of her doll. 

**General plan:**
* Beginning scene will be at the Disneyland store. Here, Dania’s mom asks her to choose a doll she would like to buy and she chooses Ariel.
* Dania holds Ariel in her hands as she walks around. Background sounds here will include conversations, Disney music, sounds of rollercoaters, and Dania’s exclamations as she sees new and exciting things. She also meets real-life Ariel and gets her autograph (some fun conversations can happen here).
* When Dania wants to go on the rides, she hands Ariel to her mom and leaves with her sister. Her mother keeps Ariel in her handbag. Here, the background outdoor sounds will be muffled/quiet and vibrations of her mom’s phone can be heard. 
* Later, you can hear Dania’s mom tell its time to leave and Dania asks for Ariel to hold. She holds Ariel in her arms, and exhausted, she falls asleep on her mom’s shoulder. In her sleep, Ariel slips from Dania’s hold. Here, her mom’s conversation on the phone fades, and for a few seconds you can hear running footsteps of children, women’s heels and all the background sound fading in and out. 
* A young girl/boy picks up Ariel and says, “Mom, look! I found this doll on the ground. Can I keep her?” The end.
